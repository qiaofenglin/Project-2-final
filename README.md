# Project-2-final
1、For projects like this your commits should be more than 10. Every time you experiment with code, commit it so you can track back to see what worked and did not work.
2、No style in your HTML! With html5 we no longer use the width or height attributes on <img>. Instead use the css width property. (-0.5 points)
3、Never ever use <br> or any other html for line spacing. All line spacing should be achieved using css. (-1 point)
